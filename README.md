# Underactuated Robotics – Python Examples

This repository contains a collection of **Python examples** from the *Underactuated Robotics* lecture notes by Russ Tedrake (MIT), pulled from the Deepnotes.
  
The material focuses on dynamics, control, planning, and estimation for underactuated robotic systems, with a strong emphasis on intuition, geometry, and physical reasoning.
