The choice of `m` ensures that even for a narrow stone where `m = 0 + 2`, the robot has the ability to place both feet on the stone so that it can position itself better to reach the next stone if needed. Additionally, if the robot needs to get across a wider stone in several steps, minimum number of steps require the robot to take as large step as possible, therefore, `m = floor(stone_horizontal_length/step_span)+2`. It is easier to add these edges while creating vertices, as demonstrated by the code template implemented for the \"lateral\" stone.\n\n**You will need to implement (marked with `TODO: MODIFY HERE`):**\n- Compute number of copies needed for each stone (note that start and final stones are same size)\n- Add vertex for copies of convex sets corresponding to \"start\", \"final\", \"bridge\" stones\n- Add fixed order edges between copies of the same stone\n\n*PLEASE NOTE*: throughout this problem, \"start\" and \"final\" will refer to stones, while \"source\" and \"target\" will refer to GCS vertices and the corresponding vertex sets."},{"block_group":"a2f1e0dc98994db6b7a690a69bd604ea","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cell_id":"586f53de24b047a2957b185e4514f6c2","deepnote_block_group":"a2f1e0dc98994db6b7a690a69bd604ea","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_sorting_key":"15","deepnote_source":"def add_vertex_and_edges_for_set_copies(G, T, step_span):\n    start_position = tuple(T.get_stone_by_name(\"initial\").center)\n    end_position = tuple(T.get_stone_by_name(\"goal\").center)\n\n    V = []  # vertices\n    E_list = (\n        []\n    )  # list of pair of vertices that can construct an edge e.g. E_list[i] = [u_i, v_i] where u_i -> v_i is a valid edge\n\n    V.append(G.AddVertex(Point(start_position), \"source\"))\n    V.append(G.AddVertex(Point(end_position), \"target\"))\n\n    # compute number of copies needed for each vertex\n    num_copy_lateral = 0  # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n    num_copy_s_t = 0  # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n    num_copy_bridge = 0  # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n\n    for i, stone in enumerate(T.stepping_stones):\n        H_i = HPolyhedron(stone.A, stone.b)\n        if stone.name == \"lateral\":\n            for ii in range(num_copy_lateral):\n                V.append(G.AddVertex(H_i, f\"l{i}_{ii}\"))\n                if ii > 0:\n                    # add edge from parent to copy\n                    E_list.append([V[-2], V[-1]])\n        elif stone.name == \"start\":\n            # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n            continue\n        elif stone.name == \"final\":\n            # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n            continue\n        else:\n            # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n            continue\n\n    return G, V, E_list"},"outputs":[],"source":"def add_vertex_and_edges_for_set_copies(G, T, step_span):\n    start_position = tuple(T.get_stone_by_name(\"initial\").center)\n    end_position = tuple(T.get_stone_by_name(\"goal\").center)\n\n    V = []  # vertices\n    E_list = (\n        []\n    )  # list of pair of vertices that can construct an edge e.g. E_list[i] = [u_i, v_i] where u_i -> v_i is a valid edge\n\n    V.append(G.AddVertex(Point(start_position), \"source\"))\n    V.append(G.AddVertex(Point(end_position), \"target\"))\n\n    # compute number of copies needed for each vertex\n    num_copy_lateral = 0  # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n    num_copy_s_t = 0  # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n    num_copy_bridge = 0  # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n\n    for i, stone in enumerate(T.stepping_stones):\n        H_i = HPolyhedron(stone.A, stone.b)\n        if stone.name == \"lateral\":\n            for ii in range(num_copy_lateral):\n                V.append(G.AddVertex(H_i, f\"l{i}_{ii}\"))\n                if ii > 0:\n                    # add edge from parent to copy\n                    E_list.append([V[-2], V[-1]])\n        elif stone.name == \"start\":\n            # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n            continue\n        elif stone.name == \"final\":\n            # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n            continue\n        else:\n            # TODO: MODIFY HERE\n            continue\n\n    return G, V, E_list"},{"block_group":"fc965a16df984bb7b1e681ae1903d694","cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cell_id":"76f6ad205f6f43e581ea23eca5e8f986","deepnote_block_group":"fc965a16df984bb7b1e681ae1903d694","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","deepnote_sorting_key":"16","deepnote_source":"Now that we have constructed vertices and edges in between vertices that are copies of the same set, we need to construct the rest of edges in the GCS.
