method](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php/Disjunctive_inequalities).\n\nThink of each stepping stone $S_i$ as a subset of $\\mathbb R^2$.\nUsing the halfspace representation,\n$$\nS_i = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb R^2 : A_i x \\leq b_i \\}.\n$$\nLet $x_t$ be the position of, e.g., the left foot at step $t$.\nThe constraint $x_t \\in \\bigcup_i S_i$ can be enforced as follows.\nWe define a binary $\\delta_{t, i} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ per stepping stone (these are the binaries `stone_left[t, i]` we defined above).\nWe add the constraint\n$$\nA_i x_t \\leq b_i + (1 - \\delta_{t, i}) M_i\n$$\nfor all $t$ and $i$, where $M_i$ is a vector of \"sufficiently large\" positive constants.\nAdditionally, as we already did in the last cell, we require\n$$\n\\sum_i \\delta_{t, i} = 1\n$$\nfor all $t$.\n\nDo you see how these two constraints do the job?\nIf $\\delta_{t, i} = 1$, from the last equation, we must have $\\delta_{t, j} = 0$ for all $j \\neq i$.\nThis implies\n$$\nA_i x_t \\leq b_i, \\quad\nA_j x_t \\leq b_j + M_j.\n$$\nTherefore $x_t$ belongs to $S_i$, while, since $M_j$ is a vector of large constants, the second inequality is redundant and does not constrain the value of $x_t$.\n\nIt's very important to notice that these constraints are linear in our decision variables ($x_t$ and $\\delta_{t, i}$).\nMixed-integer programs with nonlinear constraints are extremely hard problems, especially if some of the constraints are nonconvex.\n\nOne issue left: what's the magic value for the constants $M_i$?\nOne would be tempted to put a huge number there, but unfortunately the larger the $M_i$ the harder the problem is to be solved via branch and bound.\nIn the following cell we wrote a function that returns a vector $M$ that can be used for all $i$.\n(This is possible since our stepping stones are rectangles and they all have the same number of facets, 4, which is equal to the number of rows in $A_i$).\nIf you are not a MIP enthusiast, do not feel the need to understand the logic behind the following function."},"source":"One more constraint to add: \"if the binary `stone_left[t, i]` is one, then the left foot at step `t` must lie on the `i`th stepping stone\".\nTo enforce this constraint we use the [the big-M method](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php/Disjunctive_inequalities).\n\nThink of each stepping stone $S_i$ as a subset of $\\mathbb R^2$.\nUsing the halfspace representation,\n$$\nS_i = \\{ x \\in \\mathbb R^2 : A_i x \\leq b_i \\}.\n$$\nLet $x_t$ be the position of, e.g., the left foot at step $t$.\nThe constraint $x_t \\in \\bigcup_i S_i$ can be enforced as follows.\nWe define a binary $\\delta_{t, i} \\in \\{0, 1\\}$ per stepping stone (these are the binaries `stone_left[t, i]` we defined above).\nWe add the constraint\n$$\nA_i x_t \\leq b_i + (1 - \\delta_{t, i}) M_i\n$$\nfor all $t$ and $i$, where $M_i$ is a vector of \"sufficiently large\" positive constants.\nAdditionally, as we already did in the last cell, we require\n$$\n\\sum_i \\delta_{t, i} = 1\n$$\nfor all $t$.\n\nDo you see how these two constraints do the job?\nIf $\\delta_{t, i} = 1$, from the last equation, we must have $\\delta_{t, j} = 0$ for all $j \\neq i$.\nThis implies\n$$\nA_i x_t \\leq b_i, \\quad\nA_j x_t \\leq b_j + M_j.\n$$\nTherefore $x_t$ belongs to $S_i$, while, since $M_j$ is a vector of large constants, the second inequality is redundant and does not constrain the value of $x_t$.\n\nIt's very important to notice that these constraints are linear in our decision variables ($x_t$ and $\\delta_{t, i}$).\nMixed-integer programs with nonlinear constraints are extremely hard problems, especially if some of the constraints are nonconvex.\n\nOne issue left: what's the magic value for the constants $M_i$?\nOne would be tempted to put a huge number there, but unfortunately the larger the $M_i$ the harder the problem is to be solved via branch and bound.\nIn the following cell we wrote a function that returns a vector $M$ that can be used for all $i$.\n(This is possible since our stepping stones are rectangles and they all have the same number of facets, 4, which is equal to the number of rows in $A_i$).\nIf you are not a MIP enthusiast, do not feel the need to understand the logic behind the following function."},{"block_group":"300c0d91b8004e8db58c7f01e1c86b3f","cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"cell_id":"dcc5a2ba88d94ef88f4e5a6bbd1763a4","deepnote_block_group":"300c0d91b8004e8db58c7f01e1c86b3f","deepnote_cell_type":"code","deepnote_sorting_key":"21","deepnote_source":"#
