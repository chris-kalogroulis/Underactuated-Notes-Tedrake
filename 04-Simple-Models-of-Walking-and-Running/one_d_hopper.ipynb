The Hopping Cycle\n\nLet's analyze the four phases of the hopping cycle illustrated below.\nWe start from the **touchdown** instant $t_{\\mathrm{td}}$ (i.e. the transition from the flight phase to the stance phase).\nFor the moment we assume $\\delta (t)$ to be a nonnegative constant for all $t$ (zero in the figure).\n\nAt touchdown the leg has an impact with the ground and $z_{\\mathrm{l}} (t_{\\mathrm{td}}) = 0$.\nWe assume this impact to be inelastic, i.e., the leg does not bounce back after the collision.\nIn math: $\\dot z_{\\mathrm{l}} (t_{\\mathrm{td}}^+) = 0$, where $t_{\\mathrm{td}}^+$ denotes the instant of time immediately after touchdown.\nBecause of the spring between the leg and the body, the impulse is not transmitted to the body which continues its descent with the same velocity $\\dot z_{\\mathrm{b}} (t_{\\mathrm{td}}^+) = \\dot z_{\\mathrm{b}} (t_{\\mathrm{td}}^-) < 0$.\n\nDuring stance, the leg is pushed towards the ground by the spring force (and gravity) hence, given that $\\dot z_{\\mathrm{l}} (t_{\\mathrm{td}}^+) = 0$, the leg-ground contact cannot be broken: $z_{\\mathrm{l}} (t) = \\dot z_{\\mathrm{l}} (t) = 0$ for all $t$ during stance.\nIn contrast, the body first moves towards the ground, and then moves up towards the the hard stop of the prismatic joint.\nWe call **bottom** the moment during stance when the body has minimum altitude and zero velocity, and we denote it as $t_{\\mathrm{bt}}$.\n\nWhen the body reaches the prismatic-joint hard stop, we have a second inelastic collision.\nWe call this instant **lift off**, denoted as $t_{\\mathrm{lo}}$, since this impact between the body and the hard stop makes the leg lift off the ground.\nAn instant after this inelastic collision, the body and the leg have the same velocity $\\dot z_{\\mathrm{b}} (t_{\\mathrm{lo}}^+) = \\dot z_{\\mathrm{l}} (t_{\\mathrm{lo}}^+)$.\n\nThe flying phase starts after lift off.\nOur goal is to ensure that at the time $t_{\\mathrm{ap}}$, when the body is at the **apex** of its trajectory, we have $z_{\\mathrm{l}} (t_{\\mathrm{ap}}) = z_{\\mathrm{b}} (t_{\\mathrm{ap}}) = h$.\nNote that, during flight, there is no reason for the body to break contact with the hard stop and $l(t)$ is constantly zero.\nIn fact, in the flight phase, the body and the leg have the same initial velocity (the one after lift off), they are both subject to the same acceleration (gravity), and the spring can only push them together (if $\\delta (t) > 0$).\n\n<img
